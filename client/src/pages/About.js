      <p>
        I am an enthusiastic young developer. I am currently attending edX's
        Full Stack coding bootcamp through the University of Denver. The course
        is challenging but exciting, and I am looking forward to entering the
        professional world as a web developer. I excel in both front end and
        back end development, specializing in JavaScript ES6.
