# Jaxson-Lybbert-Portfolio

## Description: This web page displays information about me, my current status as a student at the Full Stack Coding bootcamp, and my motivation to become a proficient web developer.

## The page contains a functioning navigation bar, cards that will direct potential employers to future deployed projects, and easy ways to get into contact with me.

## This page was constructed with HTML and CSS, with the main focus being on the use of Flexbox in CSS. Variabels came into play to help maintain a consistent color scheme throughout the portfolio in the styles.css page, and Flexbox is how the layout of the webpage was acheived.

## How To Use: Simply click on the links in the navigation bar to find out more about me, see projects that I have completed (or will complete in the future), or get into contact with me. Click on the title cards to be taken to the deployed application.
